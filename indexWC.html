<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>
Wild Circus is the first (and only!) high Tech Circus in the world! We're making our exhibitions all around Europe, From France To Bulgaria.<br/>
When you come to our show, each one of you will be lended a pair of Virtual Reality Glasses, which allow you to see not only all the reality around you, but also added effects and characters.<br/>
The system is made to be the less tiring for your eyes, and has been medically tested. For that reason, our show don't last more than one hour and a half.<br/>
Please refer to our different category of demonstration to see the potential of the VR in our circus.

	<!--Circus : Human-->
<section id="human">
<h1>Wild Circus : Human show!</h1>
In our Circus, there are shows like in classic circus, with only humans!
We want to keep the ideas and traditionnal sideshows which made Circus before.
Among them, you can find jugglers 'with balls of fire), equilibrist crossing a gap (full of demons and lava trying to catch him), or also trapezists (floating into space)...
</section>

	<!--Circus : Animals-->
<section id="animals">
<h1>Wild Circus : Animals show!</h1>
At the Wild Circus, you can also enjoy some animals exhibitions! 
Here, you may never see some real wild animals, as it's complicated to take care of them correctly and make them travel.
This is the old time.
Instead of that, you will be admiring a perfect synchronisation between our 10 recruits of the dog squad and our two horses, realizing below your eyes an astonishing performance enhanced with virtual reality.
Be curious, and come to see them like thousand of people before you.
</section>

	<!--Virtual Reality only-->
<section id="virtual">
<h1>Wild Circus : The Virtual Reality at his full power</h1>
Here, no human nor animals. Only your glasses showing yout their complete capacity. On a starry sky, you can enjoy a short story with danse into space, mixing poetic images with impressive FX effects.

this website has been coded as an exercise to enter at the Wild Code School of Lyon. However, I would totally love a circus like this one, even the place for this kind of event would be so much expensive compared to a classic one.
Most of these image are not belonging to me, I took these on the internet and modified them to fit my desires because it was the fastest and easier way to realize the exercise.
